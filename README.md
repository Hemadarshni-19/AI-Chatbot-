NLTK-based AI Chatbot project

An AI Chatbot using NLTK (Python) is a text-based conversational program built with Python that uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to:

1. Understand user messages through tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
2. Match input messages against predefined patterns or intents.
3. Respond with relevant predefined responses.
Itâ€™s generally called a Rule-Based Chatbot because it follows logic defined by you rather than learning from data.
